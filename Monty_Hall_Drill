Three doors. You choose Door #1. Host open Door #3. You have an option to switch doors.
What is the probability to win if you switch doors?

P(D1) = Probability choosing Door #1
P(D2) = Probability choosing Door #2
P(D3) = Probability choosing Door #3

Initially, before choosing any doors: P(D1) = P(D2) = P(D3) = 1/3
Once you choose, say, Door #1, probability to pick Doors #2 or #3 is = 1/2
