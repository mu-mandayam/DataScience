# Downloaded the data from the Housing Affordability Data System from:

# 2013 ASCII zip file

# The file has more than 65,000 rows and 99 columns

# Tried limiting my challenge to the first 100 rows
# max_rows = 100

# The label FMR is the Rent in $
# The label LMED is the Median Income in $
#
# Trying to plot the values of FMR versus LMED for a chosen region, for e.g REGION==2 here. 
# My x-axis is LMED (or Salary) and my y-axis is FMR (or Rent)
#
# Sublist with data for region 2 only
# The list "short_list" will have a list of TRUE or FALSE flags depending on the REGION value
#
short_list = data_set['REGION']=="'2'" 
#
# From "short_list" we create "regional_list" that will have data for a particular, chosen REGION only
#
regional_list = data_set[short_list]
#
# From the regional_list we choose two columns: LMED that has the median income and FMR the rent paid
#
lmed_list = regional_list['LMED']

#
# We plot the Rent paid against the Median income to see if there is any correlation
